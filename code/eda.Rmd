## Research Questions

* How has COVID affected the health of the retail industry, as measured by employment?
* How has retail fared relative to other industries?
* Retail needs to worry about who has money to spend - what has changed about who is      working and earning money?

Assumptions
A adult (over) civilian labor force. That the severe stay-at-home lock downs happened on roughly from 2022-03-01 until 2022-05-30.

## Read in Data

Bring in the processed data and store it in the schools variable. Filter on predominately bachelor degree schools. View the data.

```{r data read}
data = read_csv("./data_processed/cps_industry_and_demographic_data.csv")

```
# Seperate Data for Questions 1 and 2
```{r data split}

# This dataset can answer question 1.
retail_data = industry_data %>% filter(INDNAME == "Retail Trade")
